# Week-4-tasks
creating circuits using Analog and Digital Sensors
I've created three circuits using different types of sensors , two of the circuits are in the Projects section and one circuit is uplaoded to the code section 
so, the first two circuits that is in the Project section are created with Tinkercad ,where I've used the Flex sensor as the analog type and the ultrasonic dist. sensor for the digital type.
for the thired circuit I've used a digital type sensor which is the DHT11 sensor and this circuit is connected physically where I've uploaded a vidoe of the circuit and testing the sensor as well as uplaoding some pics of the connections and the code too.
